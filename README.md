# Avalanche-Predictor
Final Project 

HELLO!

## Project Proposal: I want to make an avalanche predictor to help me determine the danger level of a certain day at a specific mountain area. 

Currently in Washington State, nwac.us does a great job of doing just that for the mountains within the state. My goal is to emulate using all of my skills as data scientist in hopes to make a model to use when I plan to travel and ski outside of Washington State. This would be super useful for other backcountry skiers like myself to use to determine avalanche risk!
