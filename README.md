# Avalanche-Predictor

HELLO!

## Project Proposal: I want to make an avalanche predictor to help me determine the danger level of a certain day at a specific mountain area. 

## Business Understanding

Currently in Washington State, nwac.us does a great job of doing just that for the mountains within the state. My goal is to emulate using all of my skills as data scientist in hopes to make a model to use when I plan to travel and ski outside of Washington State. This would be super useful for other backcountry skiers like myself to use to determine avalanche risk! 

## Data Understanding
- The data for a particular area is quite limited in the number of features there are. This is a challenge, but also 


Data Preparation


Modeling
K nearest neighbors to group hikes in difficulty first.? 

Evaluation


Deployment
Once I can get a model going, I hope to deploy this via Flask so I can use it!
